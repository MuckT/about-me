### Reflections and Comments

* This was a fun project. I used a while loop to force the user to enter the name. One thing I took away from this was that conditional statements must have the whole conditional on either side of the OR / AND clause, in the past I've had issues with these conditionals by only including half of the statement of one side of the clause.
