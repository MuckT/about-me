### Reflections and Comments

#### LAB - 02 Reflection

* This was a fun project. I used a while loop to force the user to enter the name. One thing I took away from this was that conditional statements must have the whole conditional on either side of the OR / AND clause, in the past I've had issues with these conditionals by only including half of the statement of one side of the clause.

* The Messing around with CSS was fun figuring out how to have the footer properly placed and not get overwritten by content was a fun stretch goal for myself. I used some code I found to hide the scrollbars; reference is 'Hide Scrollbars But Keep Functionality' in Links and Resources.

#### LAB - 03 Reflection

* This assignment went well for me, avoiding using some built-ins like .includes() was difficult; however, it forced me to think about the problem. I think the thing that stuck with me the most was short circuiting, getting the conditionals correct and the exposure to nested loops. I probably spent 7 hours on this assignment, but once again I added some extra features to the guessing game as a personal stretch goal, stripped out some functions I had previously added, and spent a bit of time fiddling with css.
