### Reflections and Comments

#### LAB - 02 Reflection

* This was a fun project. I used a while loop to force the user to enter the name. One thing I took away from this was that conditional statements must have the whole conditional on either side of the OR / AND clause, in the past I've had issues with these conditionals by only including half of the statement of one side of the clause.

* The Messing around with CSS was fun figuring out how to have the footer properly placed and not get overwritten by content was a fun stretch goal for myself. I used some code I found to hide the scrollbars; reference is 'Hide Scrollbars But Keep Functionality' in Links and Resources.

#### LAB - 03 Reflection

* Today I was reminded to read all the requirements before starting to code. I spent a bunch of time upfront messing with css, when I should have been making incremental progress to the core features; Ultimately this project took longer than expected, but was very rewarding. The introduction to short-circuits and nested for-loops was great. I found that by avoiding functions and built-ins I had to think about the problems different. I Highly enjoyed this project; I can see the curriculum ramping up and I am excited for what's to come!

#### LAB - 05 Refactor & Merge Existing Branch

* I really liked this assignment. I think making an about me site is a pretty good exercise. I am excited to refine it and remove the, in my opinion, super annoying prompts. I spent a lot of time upfront with CSS, so I didn't have as much to do at this point. I did merge back in my service worker branch.
